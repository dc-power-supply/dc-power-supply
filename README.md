## Description

An open source hardware (OSHW) benchtop DC power supply designed using open source tools *(WORK IN PROGRESS)*.

## Motivation

This project started as an effort to learn the ins and outs of KiCad because
the author needed to learn how to do a hardware design for a prototype (not
related to this project). However, this side project quickly grew into a thing
of its own. It reflects the ideas and features that the author wishes for a
modern benchtop DC power supply.

Also, the world needs a modern compact **fanless** OSHW DC power supply that fits
on the table of every engineer and hacker out there. Lets design one!

Hopefully it can evolve into something which one day will be good enough to be
built and maybe even produced as a kit or product. Or it can simply serve as a
learning experience on how to do OSHW design stuff on GitHub :o)


## Design goals

   - Add more test points
 - Review/refine PCB layout
   - Split analog and digital ground
   - Make sure tracks are wide enough
   - Minimize parasitics
   - Add more via stitching
   - Add thermal reliefs
 - Add missing KiCad 3D models
 - Rework mechanical design
   - Must be simple and beautiful
   - As compact as possible
   - Sturdy feel
 - MCU firmware
   - Create optimized GCC toolchain (http://crosstool-ng.github.io)
   - Cortex-M4:
     - Handle power control and input/output (buttons, encoder knob, USB,
       display, ethernet/LXI)
   - Cortex-M0:
     - Handle data logging
   - Implement HiSlip protocol (server)
   - Create build system files (Make or Meson)
 - Consider using MCU LPC4367JBD208 variant
